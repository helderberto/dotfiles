## Generate the SSH Keys

It's required to generate in every machine you start.

- Go to your $HOME with `cd ~`;
- Generate the new key `ssh-keygen`;

## Troubleshoot

### Antigen

If you get any problems with `antigen`, try `rm -rf ~/.antigen` after complete, close your terminal and open again to reinstall the packages from antigen.

### Homebrew

If you get any permissions problems when trying to run `brew` scripts, try to give the following permissions to your current user:
```bash
$ sudo chown -R $(whoami):admin /usr/local && sudo chmod -R g+rwx /usr/local
```
