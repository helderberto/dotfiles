# Ship Changes

## Context

Run in parallel:
- `git status` (never -uall)
- `git diff HEAD`
- `git log --oneline -10`

## Workflow

1. Review all changes from status and diff
2. Analyze recent commit style from log
3. Run quality checks in parallel:
   - `npm run lint`
   - `npm test`
4. If checks fail: report errors, STOP — do not commit or push
5. Generate commit message based on changed files matching repo style
6. Stage all files: `git add -A`
7. Commit with HEREDOC format
8. Push: `git push` (current branch)
9. Run `git status` after to verify

## Rules

- Stage ALL changes with `git add -A`
- Generate message from changed files, match repo style
- NEVER push if lint or tests fail
- NEVER force push (`-f` or `--force`)
- NEVER skip hooks
- NEVER commit secrets
- Push to current branch only
