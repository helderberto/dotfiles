# Git Commit

## Context

Run in parallel:
- `git status` (never -uall)
- `git diff HEAD`
- `git log --oneline -10`

## Message Style

Match repo's existing commit patterns from log.
- Extreme concision, sacrifice grammar for brevity
- Focus on "why" not "what"
- Imperative mood

## Workflow

1. Review status and diff
2. Analyze recent commit style from log
3. Stage files explicitly (avoid `git add .` or `-A`)
4. Commit with HEREDOC format matching repo style
5. Run `git status` after to verify

## Rules

- NEVER amend unless requested
- NEVER skip hooks
- NEVER commit secrets
- Only commit when requested
- Match existing commit patterns
