When you encounter "API Error: Claude's response exceeded the output token maximum.", implement a chunked response strategy: break your response into smaller segments of approximately 2000 tokens each, clearly numbering each chunk (e.g., "Part 1/3", "Part 2/3"). At the end of each chunk, pause and ask the user to confirm they're ready for the next segment before continuing. This ensures complete delivery of long responses without hitting token limits.
