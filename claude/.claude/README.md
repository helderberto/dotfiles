# Claude Code Development

This directory contains code and resources for developing applications using the Claude AI model by Anthropic. It includes examples, libraries, and documentation to help developers integrate Claude into their projects.

## What are Sub-Agents?

Sub-agents are specialized components or modules within a larger AI system that handle specific tasks or functions. In the context of Claude Code Development, sub-agents can be designed to perform distinct roles such as data processing, natural language understanding, or task execution. By breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable sub-agents, developers can create more efficient and modular AI applications.

- Operate independently with their own context
- Have access to specific tools or APIs
- Perform specialized functions within a larger workflow
