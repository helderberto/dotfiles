- Read files before editing them
- Extreme concision in all interactions and commits. Sacrifice grammar for brevity.
- Research unknown technical details rather than inventing
- Only stage/commit when explicitly requested
- Use `gh` CLI for GitHub operations
- No comments in code unless truly necessary. Code should be self-documenting.
- Avoid disabling eslint rules. If truly necessary, add comment explaining why.
