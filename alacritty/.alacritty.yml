# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator

# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty it self.
env:
  # TERM env customization.
  #
  # If this property is not set, alacritty will set it to xterm-256color.
  #
  # Note that some xterm terminfo databases don't declare support for italics.
  # You can verify this by checking for the presence of `smso` and `sitm` in
  # `infocmp xterm-256color`.
  TERM: xterm-256color

  # Cursor colors
  #
  # Colors which should be used to draw the terminal cursor. If these are unset,

  cursor:
    text: "0x44475a"
    cursor: "0xf8f8f2"

  # Selection colors
  #
  # Colors which should be used to draw the selection area. If selection

# Font configuration (changes require restart)
font:
  # The normal (roman) font face to use.
  # Style can be specified to pick a specific face.
  normal:
    family: Hack
    style: Regular

  # The bold font face
  bold:
    family: Hack
    style: Bold

  # The italic font face
  italic:
    family: Hack
    style: "Bold Italic"

  # Point size of the font
  size: 14.0

  # Offset is the extra space around each character. offset.y can be thought of
  # as modifying the linespacing, and offset.x as modifying the letter spacing.
  offset:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with
  # the default being at the bottom. Increase the x offset to move the glyph to
  # the right, increase the y offset to move the glyph upward.
  glyph_offset:
    x: 0
    y: 0

  # Thin stroke font rendering (macOS only)
  #
  # Thin strokes are suitable for retina displays, but for non-retina you
  # probably want this set to false.
  #
  # macOS >= 10.14.x:
  #
  # If the font quality on non-retina display looks bad then set
  # `use_thin_strokes` to `true` and enable font smoothing by running the
  # following command:
  #   `defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO`
  #
  # This is a global setting and will require a log out or restart to take
  # effect.
  use_thin_strokes: false

# When true, bold text is drawn using the bright variant of colors.
draw_bold_text_with_bright_colors: false
# Use custom cursor colors. If true, display the cursor in the cursor.foreground
# and cursor.background colors, otherwise invert the colors of the cursor.
# custom_cursor_colors: false
